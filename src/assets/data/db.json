After ruining the custard on the first attempt I retried it using an electric mixer to incorporate the sugar (until it turned a light yellow) and then I added the milk gradually (also using the mixer) before cooking it on the stove...PERFECT and extremely smooth custard. Excellent recipe...will definitely make again! Thanks Christine",
